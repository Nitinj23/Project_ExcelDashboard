This dashboard serves as a pivotal tool for the coffee company's stakeholders, facilitating strategic decision-making by offering comprehensive insights into sales performance. By analyzing sales trends, customer preferences, and regional performance, stakeholders can optimize product offerings, tailor marketing strategies, and allocate resources effectively. The dashboard's primary focus lies in visualizing key metrics such as total sales by coffee type, sales by country, and top customer analysis. Through the integration of data from multiple sources and the utilization of Pivot Tables for analysis, stakeholders gain a holistic view of the company's sales landscape. The methodology employed in developing the dashboard emphasizes usability, clarity, and interactivity. Index, Match, and If formulas ensure accurate data retrieval and clarity, while slicers enable users to delve into specific periods, product attributes, and customer segments, empowering stakeholders to extract actionable insights and drive informed decision-making processes.
